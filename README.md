# üß† MedGuide AI ‚Äî A Private AI Agent for Understanding Health Reports and Medications

## ü©∫ **What it Does**

**MedGuide AI** helps everyday people understand:

* Lab test results (e.g., blood work, thyroid reports)
* Prescription medications (what they are, how to take them, side effects)
* Medical jargon in doctor's notes or visit summaries

And it does all this **locally**, ensuring **privacy** and **offline accessibility**.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Problem it Solves

Most people:

* Get confused by lab results like: ‚ÄúTSH = 4.9 mIU/L‚Äù
* Don‚Äôt know how to interpret medications like ‚ÄúLosartan 50mg BID‚Äù
* Avoid reading clinical documents because they‚Äôre filled with jargon

They Google everything, get overwhelmed, and sometimes misinterpret crucial information.

### üí° How It Works

1. User uploads a PDF or photo of a lab report or prescription

2. The agent extracts structured data from the document

3. It uses a **local LLM** (via Ollama) + RAG (medical glossary, drugs DB)

4. Outputs an easy-to-understand explanation like:

   > ‚ÄúYour TSH level is slightly high. This may suggest underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism). You may want to consult your doctor.‚Äù

   or:

   > ‚ÄúLosartan is a medication used to lower blood pressure. ‚ÄòBID‚Äô means twice daily.‚Äù

5. Optionally, the agent can:

   * Set a **reminder to take meds**
   * Generate a **summary for a family member**
   * Offer a **list of follow-up questions** to ask the doctor
